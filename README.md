Noise in MRI (2019) - Educational and practical guide
====================================================

This is the code repository of the CRMSB (CNRS - University of Bordeaux / UMR5536), Bordeaux, France

to reproduce the reconstruction results of

> [1] K. P. Pruessmann, M. Weiger, P. Börnert, and P. Boesiger (2001),
> Advances in sensitivity encoding with arbitrary k-space trajectories
> Magnetic Resonance in Medicine 46(4), 638-651

as put forwards by the ISMRM Reproducible Research Study Group.

The code is largely based on a tutorial developed by Bertram J. Wilm and Klaas P.
Pruessmann for an Educational Session on Reconstruction at ESRMRB 2012, in Lisbon, Portugal.

Requirements
------------

This code is written in Matlab, 2016a, but most likely works with earlier or later versions.



Getting Started
---------------

We provide two ways of evaluating our results, depending on whether you have
access to Matlab environment on your system:

### Matlab
1. Clone this repository into a project folder of your liking, e.g. via
   `git clone https://github.com/mrtm-zurich/rrsg-arbitrary-sense.git rrsg-arbitrary-sense`
   - Note: The `data` subfolder of the repo already contains the example data from
   http://www.user.gwdg.de/~muecker1/rrsg_challenge.zip
2. Run `code/main.m`.
    - The main script calls three functions creating the Figures 4 to 6 from the original paper.
	- They should correspond to figure 4,5, and 6 in the original MRM paper.
	- The created Matlab Figures are saved as PNGs to the `results/` subfolder of the project folder.
3. Note: If you just want to try out the reconstruction pipeline (load data, get SENSE map, run recon)
   for one undersampling factor), run `demoRecon.m` instead of `main.m` in the
   `code` subfolder of the repository.


Results
-------

In order to address the goals of the submission, we provide the following result files, reflecting the current state of the repository:

1. The algorithm including gridding and FFT, SENSE map calculation, deapodization,
   k-space filtering and ringing filter was implemented as in [1]. To try out the pipeline for a single dataset and
   reconstruction, run `demoRecon.m` in the main repository folder.
	- Note that the SENSE maps were calculated following
	> [2] D. O. Walsh, A. F. Gmitro, and M. W. Marcellin, Adaptive reconstruction of phased array MR imagery,
	> Magnetic Resonance in Medicine, vol. 43, no. 5, pp. 682–690, May 2000.
	- Only the central, fully sampled part of the provided radial data (about 60 samples of each spoke for the brain data) were utilized for this computation. For the heart dataset all samples were used to calculate the SENSE maps.
2. The figure reproducing reconstruction errors of R=2,3,4,5 undersampled brain
   data is provided in `results/Figure4_brain_logDeltaOverIterations.png`
    - Note that the upper-case delta, i.e., the relative deviation from the exact solution, cannot be computed in the absence of a ground truth for the imaged object. Therefore, we
	reconstructed an image with R=1 and picked it as the ground truth for calculating the reconstruction error for R>2.
3. Reconstruction results for R=1,2,3,4 undersampled brain data are stored in
   two PNG files for better readability,
   `results/Figure5_brain_undersamplingRecon_part{1,2}.png`
4. Reconstructions of the provided cardiac data using the first 11,22,33,44,55
   spokes (R=5,4,3,2,1 respectively) are provided in
   `results/Figure6_heart_undersamplingRecon.png`.
